	<li> McConnell's Turkish Coffee Ice Cream </li>
	<p> This ice cream originated in Santa Barbara California. This Ice Cream has a deliciously intense taste. It sports a roasty, dark chocolate flavor with the addition of coffee particles in the ice cream. In terms of authenticity this is the best one. Although, it does cost a pretty penny; you can buy it on McConnell's site for $12.</p>

<div class= "center">
	<img src="Tradecoff.png" alt="Tradecoff" height="250" width="450">
</div>

	<li> Trader Joe's Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream </li>
	<p> This ice cream also has a very intense coffee flavor. If you favor dark-roasted coffee this one is definitely the one for you. This also has coffee particles mized in although thw=ey are finer than McConnell's. </p>

<div class= "center">
	<img src="oatcoff.png" alt="Oatcoff" height="250" width="450">
</div>

	<li> Oat Coffee Frozen Dessert </li>
	<p> This ice cream is actually a dairy alternative. But despite that it rates pretty highly among coffee ice cream lovers. Of course because it is made using oats it does have an oaty taste. However, the coffee flavor still comes through quite pleasantley. </p>

<div class= "center">
	<img src="Turkeycoff.png" alt="Turkeycoff" height="250" width="450">
</div>

	<li> Turkey Hill Colombian Coffee</li>
	<p> This specific ice cream is a bit on the milder side. Whereas, the previous ice creams that I stated before had an intense coffee flavor. This one is more round and well balanced. It reminds some of an expresso mixed with the right amount of cream. Not too light but not too overpowering the perfect balance.</p>

<div class= "center">
	<img src="Vancoff.png" alt="Vancoff" height="250" width="450">
</div>

	<li> Van Leeuwen Mocha Cookie Crumble</li>
	<p> Now this specific ice cream is not just a coffee based ice cream. There are additional mix-ins within this flavor. However, these mix-ins really help this ice cream to stand out from the rest of its competition. These add-ins help to provide a balance to the coffee flavor within this ice cream giving it a pleasant flavor. </p>
